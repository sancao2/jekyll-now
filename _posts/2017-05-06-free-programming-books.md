I have download parts of [free-programming-books.md](https://github.com/sancao2/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md). And I share them with [Resilio Sync](https://www.resilio.com/individuals/) which is p2p file synchronization tool. The Read Only key is BLXA6HOCLN2XWZDQ6DILEJYWYNMTNGBKM. Welcome to sync it.

If there is PDF, I will download PDF. If not, I will download the html.

The list which I download is below:

```shell
âžœ  en ls
C           Emacs       Java        Lisp        Python      Standard ML
C++         Haskell     Linux       Ocaml       Scheme      Unix
```

I just wish it save your time. But it has too many books which are overwhelming and distracting. Read one fully is better than own 1000. And some of them are outdated. So I wana spend some time taking out several best books in some Areas like Python, C++.
