I have download parts of [free-programming-books.md](https://github.com/sancao2/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md). And I share them with [Resilio Sync](https://www.resilio.com/individuals/) which is p2p file synchronization tool. The Read Only key is BLXA6HOCLN2XWZDQ6DILEJYWYNMTNGBKM. Welcome others to sync it.

The list which I download is below:

> Haskell     Lisp        Python      Standard ML
